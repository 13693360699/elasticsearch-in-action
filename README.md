This repository contains the code examples from the book [*Elasticsearch in Action*][2].

When do I need them?
--------------------

You will need to index the sample data provided before you run the searches from Chapter 2 and Chapter 4.

How do I index the sample data?
-------------------------------

    # clone the repository
    git clone git@github.com:dakrone/elasticsearch-in-action.git

    # index the sample data
    elasticsearch-in-action/populate.sh

I have questions or suggestions for these samples
-------------------------------------------------

You have feedback? We'd be glad to hear it from you on the [book's forum][1]. You can also send pull requests or open issues on this repository.

Happy reading and Elasticsearch-ing!
